3. What is Middleware?

4. What is an endpoint?


## Answers

1. Node is an open source, cross platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

2. Express is a node platform that allows JavaScript to be used outside the Web Browsers, for creating web and network applications. This allows us to create the server and server-side code for an application using JavaScript. 

3. Middleware is computer software that provides service to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. "It can be described as 'software glue.' Middleware makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application."

4. An endpoint is the URL where service can be accessed by a client application.
